# Fanuc

This is a ROS-on-Windows repo 99.99% similar to the original for someone that would like to use ROS-Industrial for FANUC robots out-of-the box. 

## Note

* The README of the original repo contains instructions about downloading, installing and building of the packages
* The packages have been used on Windows with ROS Kinetic and ROS Melodic
* No official testing has taken place
* The IKFast plugins existing for some of the manipulators are deprecated and `opw_kinematics` will be the official kinematics solver. This solver has been built easily on Windows and performs well
